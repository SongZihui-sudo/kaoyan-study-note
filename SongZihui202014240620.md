# Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of intelligent devices and sensors that are connected and communicate with each other through the Internet. This network is capable of collecting, transmitting, and analyzing various types of data in order to achieve greater efficiency and intelligence in production and services. With IoT, businesses and consumers can benefit from real-time data insights, remote monitoring and control, and personalized experiences.    

Base on the IoT, We can make many product like wearable smart devices（Smart watches, smart bracelets, smart glasses），Intelligent furniture equipment（Temperature and humidity sensor, lamp with intelligent brightness adjustment）, Intelligent sensor on factory assembly line.
